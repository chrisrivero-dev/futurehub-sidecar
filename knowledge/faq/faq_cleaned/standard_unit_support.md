# Standard Unit Support

Standard Units are USB-controlled miners that can either be:

- Connected to a Full Node unit for easy power upgrade, or
- Connected directly to another PC or Raspberry Pi for independent mining. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}

## Setup with Full Node Unit

1. Plug in the unit’s AC or PCIe power cables.
2. Connect the standard unit to the Full Node via USB.
3. Reboot the Full Node — it should automatically detect the standard unit. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}

If connecting to an Apollo BTC, ensure your OS is upgraded to a version supporting the Standard Unit. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}

## Setup with PC / Raspberry Pi

Download control software for your platform and follow included instructions to configure pool and miner settings. :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}
