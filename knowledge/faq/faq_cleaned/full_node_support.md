## Setup with Monitor, Keyboard, and Mouse

Connect an HDMI monitor and USB keyboard/mouse, power on the unit, and follow the on-screen setup instructions. Default login password: `futurebit123`. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}

## Setup Over Ethernet

Connect an ethernet cable to your Apollo and network, then access the Apollo via:

- `futurebit-apollo-2.local`
- `futurebit-apollo-btc.local`

If these don’t work, use a network scanning app or your router’s device list to find the IP address. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}

The Apollo OS is stored on the internal Micro SD card. You may need to flash or update it if required. Instructions and releases are available via support links. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}
