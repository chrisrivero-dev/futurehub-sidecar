## Full Node Unit Setup

### Setting up with a Monitor, Keyboard, and Mouse

Connect an HDMI monitor and USB keyboard/mouse to your Apollo unit. Power up the unit; you should see the login screen. Follow the onscreen instructions to complete setup. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

### Setting up Over Ethernet

Connect your Apollo to your local network. It should be accessible via a browser using:

- `futurebit-apollo-2.local`
- `futurebit-apollo-btc.local`

If these names don’t work, use a network scanner or your router’s device list to find the IP address. Once found, enter it in the browser to access the web UI and continue setup. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
