    "question": "I powered on my Apollo, but I can’t access the dashboard. What should I do?",
    "answer": "Make sure your Apollo is connected to your local network via Ethernet. Try accessing the dashboard using futurebit-apollo-2.local or futurebit-apollo-btc.local. If those do not work, use your router’s device list or a network scanner to find the Apollo’s IP address and enter it directly into your browser.",
